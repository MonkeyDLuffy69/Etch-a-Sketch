# What is this?

I made this project while running through the Web Development 101 course at The Odin Project, which I (still, and always will) highly recommend. The end result as it currently stands can be viewed [here](https://monkeydluffy69.github.io/Etch-a-Sketch/).

It is designed to be remeniscent of an [Etch-a-Sketch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Etch_A_Sketch), which I was surprised to learn is actually considered a somewhat serious drawing tool by some.
