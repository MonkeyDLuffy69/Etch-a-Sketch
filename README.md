What is this?
I made this project while running through the Web Development 101 course at The Odin Project, which I (still, and always will) highly recommend. The end result as it currently stands can be viewed here.

It is designed to be remeniscent of an Etch-a-Sketch, which I was surprised to learn is actually considered a somewhat serious drawing tool by some. People with the requisite skillset can do amazing things with it. I've never been much of a visual artist myself, which is why I chose to christen my knock-off 'Botch-a-Sketch'. But I had fun developing this replica in my quest to learn JavaScript!
