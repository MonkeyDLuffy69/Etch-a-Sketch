I made this project while running through the Web Development 101 course at The Odin Project, which I (still, and always will) highly recommend. The end result as it currently stands can be viewed here.

It is designed to be remeniscent of an Etch-a-Sketch, which I was surprised to learn is actually considered a somewhat serious drawing tool by some.
